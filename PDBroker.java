/*
 * Will bind to a well known port (7654) which clients connect to.
 * 
 * After accepting a connection will fork off a thread to deal with it.
 * 
 * Server will inquire as to what the client wants.  (send HELLO?)
 * Client replies with "Introducing XXX" where XXX is a string with the programs name.
 * Server replies with a new port number for communication to happen on.
 * Client reconnects on that port
 * Server replies with "JOIN, TEST or QUIT"
 * 
 * Supported options that the client sends back are:
 * TEST - play a test game  (runTestSession method)
 * JOIN - join the main broker which will schedule round robin games.
 * QUIT - causes server to exit. No further talking with client.
 * 
 * For TEST:
 * Client replies with which option.
 * Server sends BEGIN
 * Client sends a move (DEFECT or COOPERATE)
 * Server responds with either GAMEOVER or  O-XXX where XXX is either DEFECT or COOPERATE
 * 
 * 
 * The actual game interface for clients is identical for TEST and JOIN, it 
 * is only the initial connection that varies.
 * 
 * Version 0 - 19-Mar-2020 - stub code started.
 * Version 1 - 20-Mar-2020 - QUIT implemented and tested.
 * Version 2 - 20-Mar-2020 implement TEST (always cooperate).  
 * Version 3 - 20-Mar-2020 Updated talking protocol to include an introduction
 *                          Changed behavior of TEST to be a little more dynamic
 *                          Trying to add port hand off.
 * Version 4 - 21-Mar-2020 Prints out my IP address to allow others to bind to me.
 * Version 5 - 26-Mar-2020 Get two clients playing each other.
 * Version 6 - 27-Mar-2020 Adding in Round robin for multiple players.
 * Version 7 - 28-Mar-2020 Added in send COMPETITIONOVER at end of all round robins so clients can leave.
 *                          Also closed out the datastreams at end of competition.
 * Version 8 - 31-Mar-2020 Implement basic scoring.
